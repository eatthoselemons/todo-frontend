# Things that the app is supposed to do

- recursive task definitions
- save task definitions of common tasks
- add child tasks to existing tasks
- View tasks in a kanban board view
- order tasks/deprioritize them
- text only editing, edit some sort of uml files? Don't want to have to create *in* a ui
- 

# Ideas
- ideas -> tasks pipeline?
- notify partners when completed more than x number?
- github like activity diagram?
- 
-

# MVP
