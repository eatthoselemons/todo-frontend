# Refactoring Plan: DDD + Grokking Simplicity + Effect-TS

## Guiding Principles

### Domain-Driven Design (Scott Wlaschin)
- Make illegal states unrepresentable
- Use value objects to wrap primitives
- Domain logic in pure functions
- Separate domain from infrastructure
- Railway-oriented programming for error handling

### Grokking Simplicity (Eric Normand)
- **Avoid Primitive Obsession**: Wrap primitives in branded types
- **Stratified Design**: Clear layers (actions → calculations → data)
- **Separate Actions from Calculations**: Pure functions vs side effects
- **Immutability**: No mutation of domain objects

### Effect-TS Integration
- Use Effect for error handling and async operations
- Leverage branded types (Schema) for domain primitives
- Service pattern with Effect.Service for DI
- Layer pattern for composition

---

## Phase 1: Domain Model Foundation ✅ IN PROGRESS

**Goal**: Create proper domain types with branded primitives, eliminating primitive obsession

### 1.1 Create Value Objects (Branded Types)
- [x] Create `TaskId` branded type (not just `string`)
- [x] Create `TaskText` branded type with validation
- [x] Create `TaskPath` branded type 
- [x] Create `Timestamp` branded type
- [x] Create `DueDate` branded type with validation
- [ ] Replace all primitive usages in domain

### 1.2 Refactor TaskState 
- [x] Make TaskState a proper sum type (discriminated union)
- [x] Add state transition validation
- [x] Remove mutation from domain model
- [ ] Create pure state transition functions

### 1.3 Refactor Task Entity
- [x] Make Task immutable
- [x] Replace constructor with smart constructors (Effect)
- [x] Add validation rules
- [x] Separate Task data from Task behavior
- [ ] Create TaskAggregate with invariants

### 1.4 Create Domain Events
- [ ] Define TaskCreated, TaskUpdated, TaskCompleted events
- [ ] Add event sourcing foundation
- [ ] Transition from mutation to events

---

## Phase 2: Calculation Layer (Pure Functions) ✅ COMPLETED

**Goal**: Extract all domain logic into pure, testable calculations

### 2.1 Task Calculations ✅
- ✅ `isTaskOverdue`: (Task, CurrentTime) → boolean
- ✅ `getTaskDepth`: Task → number
- ✅ `wasCompletedToday`: (Task, Date) → boolean
- ✅ `getDaysUntilDue`: (Task, Date) → number
- ✅ `compareByDueDate`: (Task, Task) → number
- ✅ And 10+ more pure task functions

### 2.2 Path Calculations ✅
- ✅ `isDescendantOf`: (Task, TaskId) → boolean
- ✅ `getParentId`: Task → TaskId | undefined
- ✅ `buildChildPath`: (TaskPath, TaskId) → TaskPath
- ✅ `calculateMovedPath`: (TaskId, TaskPath) → TaskPath
- ✅ `findCommonAncestor`: (TaskPath, TaskPath) → TaskId
- ✅ And 10+ more pure path functions

### 2.3 Tree Calculations ✅
- ✅ `buildTaskTree`: (Task[], TaskId) → TaskTree
- ✅ `flattenTree`: TaskTree → Task[]
- ✅ `findInTree`: (TaskTree, TaskId) → Task
- ✅ `updateInTree`: (TaskTree, TaskId, Updater) → TaskTree
- ✅ `filterTree`, `mapTree`, `sortTree`
- ✅ And 15+ more pure tree functions

### 2.4 Progress Calculations ✅
- ✅ `calculateProgress`: Task[] → ProgressStats
- ✅ `calculateVelocity`: (Task[], DateRange) → number
- ✅ `calculateBurndown`: (Task[], DateRange) → BurndownPoint[]
- ✅ `calculateAverageCycleTime`: Task[] → number
- ✅ And 10+ more pure progress functions

**All functions are PURE** - no side effects, fully testable!

---

## Phase 3: Service Layer (Effect Services) ✅ COMPLETED

**Goal**: Wrap actions (DB, side effects) in Effect services

### 3.1 Create Repository Service ✅
- ✅ Define `TaskRepository` interface (13 methods)
- ✅ Implement PouchDB adapter with Effect
- ✅ Add proper error types (NotFound, DbError, ConstraintViolation, etc.)
- ✅ Use Context.GenericTag for DI
- ✅ Stream support for real-time updates

### 3.2 Create Command Services ✅
- ✅ `createTask`: Handle task creation with validation
- ✅ `updateTaskText`: Update task text
- ✅ `transitionTaskState`: State transitions
- ✅ `completeTask`: Mark as done
- ✅ `moveTask`: Move with cascade path updates
- ✅ `deleteTask`: Delete with cascade
- ✅ `clearSubtasks`: Delete children only
- ✅ `setTaskDueDate`: Update due date

### 3.3 Create Query Services ✅
- ✅ `getTask`: Fetch single task
- ✅ `getTaskTree`: Build task hierarchy
- ✅ `getRootTaskForest`: Get all root trees
- ✅ `getOverdueTasks`: Filter overdue
- ✅ `getTasksByState`: Filter by state
- ✅ `searchTasks`: Text search
- ✅ `getChildren`, `getDescendants`: Hierarchy queries

**All using pipe composition (no Effect.gen)!**

## Phase 4: Refactor Infrastructure

**Goal**: Clean separation of infrastructure from domain

### 4.1 Database Layer
- [ ] Create PouchDB adapter with Effect
- [ ] Implement proper error handling
- [ ] Add retry logic for failed operations
- [ ] Create database schema migrations

### 4.2 YAML Import/Export
- [ ] Refactor to use domain types
- [ ] Add proper validation with Schema
- [ ] Use Effect for parsing errors
- [ ] Make pure (separate parsing from IO)

### 4.3 Hooks Refactoring
- [ ] Convert `useTaskHooks` to use Effect services
- [ ] Separate queries from commands
- [ ] Add proper error handling in UI
- [ ] Use Effect.useEffect for async ops

---

## Phase 5: Application Layer

**Goal**: Compose services into use cases

### 5.1 Commands (Write Operations)
- [ ] CreateTaskUseCase: Create + notify + update UI
- [ ] CompleteTaskUseCase: Complete + cascade + emit event
- [ ] MoveTaskUseCase: Move + update paths + validate
- [ ] DeleteTaskUseCase: Delete + cascade + cleanup

### 5.2 Queries (Read Operations)  
- [ ] GetTaskHierarchyQuery: Optimized tree fetch
- [ ] GetUpcomingTasksQuery: Filter + sort
- [ ] GetCompletedTodayQuery: Filter by date
- [ ] SearchTasksQuery: Full-text search

### 5.3 Event Handling

- [ ] Update TreeNode to use commands  
- [ ] Add proper error boundaries
- [ ] Show loading states with Effect

### 6.2 Form Validation

- [ ] 100% pure functions in calculation layer
- [ ] All side effects wrapped in Effect
- [ ] All errors typed and handled
